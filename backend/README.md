> **YourBench** is an open-source framework for generating domain-specific benchmarks in a zero-shot manner. It aims to keep your large language models on their toes – even as new data sources, domains, and knowledge demands evolve.

YourBench tackles a critical evaluation gap for LLMs. Traditional static benchmarks are quickly **saturated** or contaminated by training data, making it hard to assess models on new knowledge. Domain-specific or up-to-date evaluation is often costly and slow with human annotation. **YourBench addresses this by enabling dynamic, automated generation of reliable, domain-tailored benchmarks directly from your data, without manual labeling**. In a recent study, YourBench replicated several subsets of a popular benchmark (MMLU) using minimal source text for **under \$15** in total cost, while preserving the original ranking of model performance (Spearman ρ = 1). By grounding questions in user-provided documents, YourBench ensures evaluations stay relevant and **truly test a model’s knowledge on content it hasn’t seen before**.

## Installation

YourBench is available on PyPI and requires **Python 3.12+**. You can install it as follows:

* **Install via PyPI (stable release):**

  ```bash
  # uv (recommended; get it here: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
  uv pip install yourbench

  # pip (standard support)
  pip install yourbench
  ```

  This will install the latest published version (e.g. `0.3.1`).

* **Install from source (development version):**

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/huggingface/yourbench.git
  cd yourbench
  
  # uv, recommended
  uv venv
  source .venv/bin/activate
  uv pip install -e .

  # pip
  pip install -e .
  ```

  Installing from source is recommended if you want the latest updates or to run the included example configuration.

> **Note:** If you plan to use models that require API access (e.g. OpenAI GPT-4o or Hugging Face Inference API), make sure to have the appropriate credentials. You’ll also need a Hugging Face token (to optionally to upload results). See below for how to configure these before running YourBench.

## Quickstart Usage

Once installed, YourBench can be run from the command line to generate a custom evaluation set. Here’s a quick example:

```bash
# 1. (Optional) If not done already, install YourBench
pip install yourbench

# 2. Prepare your API credentials (for model inference and Hub access)
# For example, create a .env file with required keys:
# echo "OPENROUTER_API_KEY=<your_openrouter_api_key>" >> .env        # Example
echo "HF_TOKEN=<your_huggingface_api_token>" >> .env              # Hugging Face token (for Hub datasets & inference)
echo "HF_ORGANIZATION=<your_hf_username_or_org>" >> .env          # (Optional) Organization name for dataset pushing

# 3. Run the pipeline on the provided example config (uses sample docs and models)
yourbench run --config example/configs/simple_example.yaml

# 4. (Optional) Run the pipeline on your own documents:
yourbench run --config my_custom_config.yaml
```

The **example configuration** `example/configs/simple_example.yaml` (included in the repository) demonstrates a basic setup. It specifies sample documents and default models for each stage of the pipeline. In step 3 above, YourBench will automatically ingest the example documents, generate a set of Q\&A pairs, and output a Hugging Face Dataset containing the evaluation questions and answers.

For your own data, you can create a YAML config pointing to your documents and preferred models. For instance, you might specify a folder of PDFs or text files under a `documents` field, and choose which LLM to use for question generation. **YourBench is fully configurable** – you can easily **toggle stages** on or off and swap in different models. *For example: you could disable the summarization stage for very short texts, or use a powerful, large, API model for question generation while using a faster local model for summarization.* The possibilities are endless! Simply adjust the YAML, and the pipeline will accommodate it. (See the [usage example](https://github.com/huggingface/yourbench/blob/main/example/configs/advanced_example.yaml) for all available options!)

## Process Flow

![YourBench pipeline process flow diagram – from document ingestion to evaluation](docs/assets/yourbench_pipeline.png)

Under the hood, YourBench follows a multi-stage pipeline to turn raw documents into a ready-to-use benchmark dataset:

1. **Document Ingestion** – Convert PDFs, HTML, Word docs, or raw text files into a standardized format (Markdown) for downstream processing.
2. **Summarization** – Generate a concise *global summary* of each document using a designated summarization model. This helps distill key points and limit the scope for question generation.
3. **Chunking** – Split documents into smaller chunks (and optionally merge small pieces) based on semantic similarity or length constraints. This ensures long or complex documents are broken into manageable sections for Q\&A generation.
4. **Question Generation** – For each chunk (or combination of chunks), generate questions:

   * *Single-Hop:* Create straightforward questions answerable from a single chunk.
   * *Multi-Hop:* Combine multiple chunks to produce more complex questions that require integrating information from different parts of the content.
5. **Deduplication** – Remove or group together near-duplicate questions using embedding-based similarity, to avoid redundant entries in your benchmark.
6. **Analysis** – Evaluate the question set for coverage and difficulty. YourBench provides logging and analysis tools to measure how well the questions cover the source content, the distribution of topics, estimated difficulty levels, etc., and can run custom analysis modules.
7. **Export** – Finally, output the generated Q\&A benchmark. The results can be saved as a local dataset (using the Hugging Face `datasets` format) or even uploaded to the Hugging Face Hub for sharing. This makes it easy to evaluate models on the new benchmark or even set up a public leaderboard.

Throughout this process, **YourBench ensures the questions are grounded in your provided documents**, rather than what an LLM might already know. By using documents (and even an optional fresh document dataset like *Tempora-0325* for time-sensitive topics), the pipeline minimizes reliance on a model’s parametric memory, yielding more truthful and up-to-date evaluation queries.

## Try it Online (Hugging Face Spaces)

You can **try YourBench right away in your browser** – no installation needed:

* **[YourBench Demo Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/yourbench/demo)** – Use our ready-to-go web demo to upload a document (or paste text) and generate a custom evaluation set with **one click**, complete with an instant model leaderboard. **(This free demo will use a default set of models to answer the questions and show how different models perform.)**
* **[YourBench Advanced Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/yourbench/advanced)** – For power users, the advanced demo lets you provide a custom YAML config and plug in your own models or API endpoints. This gives you full control over the pipeline (choose specific models, adjust chunking parameters, etc.) via a convenient UI, right from the browser.

👉 Both hosted apps are available on Hugging Face Spaces under the **[yourbench](https://huggingface.co/yourbench)** organization. Give them a try to see how YourBench can generate benchmarks tailored to your use-case in minutes.
