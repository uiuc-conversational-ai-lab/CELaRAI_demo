## Viewing Sample Questions

Once you have run the pipeline and generated the `single_shot_questions` and
`multi_hop_questions` subsets, you can quickly preview a handful of them from
the command line.

```bash
# syntax: yourbench analyze view_sample_questions CONFIG_PATH [SAMPLE_SIZE]

yourbench analyze view_sample_questions example/configs/simple_example.yaml 5
````

* **`CONFIG_PATH`** – path to the YAML/JSON config you used for the pipeline.
* **`SAMPLE_SIZE`** – *(optional, default = 5)* number of random questions to
  display from each subset.

The command prints two Rich tables:

| Column         | Description                                           |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Q #**        | Running index of the sampled question                 |
| **Q Type**     | Model-reported category (factual, conceptual, etc.)   |
| **Question**   | Full text of the question                             |
| **Answer**     | Correct answer (or correct option letter)             |
| **Choices**    | Multiple-choice options if present; “N/A” otherwise   |
| **Difficulty** | Estimated difficulty 1-10 (as generated by the model) |

This quick preview is handy for:

* sanity-checking that generation looks reasonable before large runs;
* spot-checking difficulty levels or citation formatting;
* debugging prompt or parsing issues without opening full datasets.
